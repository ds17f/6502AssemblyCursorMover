# 6502AssemblyCursorMover
A 6502 Experiment to move a cursor

I was writing this on my phone but it's cumbersome so I'm going to do this on the computer
but I'll use the 6502 emulator that comes with this app [Learn 6502 Assembly](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.redlee90.learn6502assembly&hl=en_US&gl=US)


The goal is to move a cursor on the screen and use the a/b buttons to change the color
Stretch goal is to "draw" on the screen using one of the buttons to leave a drawing trail
